    <h1>WHAT IS PHOTOGRAPHY</h1>
    <p2><span class="text-info">The word Photography literally means 'drawing with light', which derives from the Greek photo, meaning light and graph, meaning to draw. Photography is the process of recording an image – a photograph – on lightsensitive film or, in the case of digital photography, via a digital electronic or magnetic memory.</span></p2>

        <h2>TYPES OF PHOTOGRAPHY</h2>
        <p1><span class="text-warning">By learning and practicing the seven different types of photography below, you can build a strong foundation for your photography career.</span></p1>
        <p2><span class="text-warning">The word "photography" was created from the Greek roots φωτός (phōtós), genitive of φῶς (phōs), "light"and γραφή (graphé) "representation by means of lines" or "drawing",together meaning "drawing with light".

          Several people may have coined the same new term from these roots independently. Hercules Florence, a French painter and inventor living in Campinas, Brazil, used the French form of the word, photographie, in private notes which a Brazilian historian believes were written in 1834. This claim is widely reported but is not yet largely recognized internationally. The first use of the word by the Franco-Brazilian inventor became widely known after the research of Boris Kossoy in 1980.
          
          The German newspaper Vossische Zeitung of 25 February 1839 contained an article entitled Photographie, discussing several priority claims – especially Henry Fox Talbot's – regarding Daguerre's claim of invention. The article is the earliest known occurrence of the word in public print. It was signed "J.M.", believed to have been Berlin astronomer Johann von Maedler. The astronomer Sir John Herschel is also credited with coining the word, independent of Talbot, in 1839.
          
          The inventors Nicéphore Niépce, Henry Fox Talbot and Louis Daguerre seem not to have known or used the word "photography", but referred to their processes as "Heliography" (Niépce), "Photogenic Drawing"/"Talbotype"/"Calotype" (Talbot) and "Daguerreotype" (Daguerre).</span></p2>

          <h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
          <p1> <span class="text-warning">Photography might seem easy to some people but there is a lot to it. One thing that shouldn't be forgotten is light exposure, make sure its the perfect combination of light and dark.
            If someone were to choose what the most important thing in photography they would say light exposure. It's a given idea, if you don't have good lighting in your photo then it isn't a quality photo. Light can give that dreamlike, golden look, and if you get the sun and focus the right way you can get the bokeh effect, which plenty of photographers enjoy. My primary resource was an email written to a family friend named Beth Hutter, who is a professional photographer, she has her own website and studio. (bb-photography.com). I chose the question of 'What are the main points to become a good photographer?' because I want to take on photography as a hobby of my own and with that, hopefully manage a successful YouTube account. I learned that some of the most important things to become a good photographer is know your camera, focus on the light exposure, practice, and learn more from other photographers. In conclusion, photography has a lot of main points, but it's the little things that count the most. Photography is researched plenty and a lot of people would like tot all on the photography career, as a main job or even a little hobby. A getaway.</span></p1>
